### 1.1 🧱 Shlib System, nala, zsh-1 & Install-Policy

#### Nala

```shell
# use nala instead of apt
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nala
sudo nala update && sudo nala upgrade
```

#### Zshell Part 1

In order to apply the shlib system directly to the zshell, it is installed at the very beginning of the installation process (.zshrc). The actual setup takes place in point 1.6 together with antipode and p10k.

```shell
# Install and switch to zsh
sudo nala install -y zsh && chsh -s $(which zsh)
# ⚠️ A full re-login (logout/login) is required so that login shells pick up zsh.
# 'exec zsh' only replaces the current interactive shell, not the login session.
# shlib it --> 10-zsh-config.sh
# and insert: setopt INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS
# ⚠️ This is important so that copy/paste works properly, without it the comment symbol '#' is not allowed
```

#### Shlib System

The Shlib (Shell Library) system keeps the `.zshrc` file clean and manageable by moving shell configuration into sorted, versioned files.

* **Architecture**

Three components in `.zshrc`:

1. **Lock Check** — Detects unauthorized changes to `.zshrc`
2. **Exports Loader** — Files in `~/.shlib/exports/` become env vars (filename = varname, content = value)
3. **Library Loader** — Sorted scripts in `~/.shlib/shlibs/` are sourced in order

* **Convention**

The numbering is freely selectable. However, it is recommended to stick to the numbering from the developer environment and the ai stack.

* **Setup**

```shell
# create folders
mkdir -p ~/.shlib/exports ~/.shilb/shlibs

# To be on the safe side, exclude the contents of the export folder from Github
echo  "# Ignore everything in this directory\n*\n# Except this file\n\!.gitignore" > ~/.shlib/exports

# For Luxus Python Stack, replace path and number with yours
ln -s ~/gits/deen-lupysta/luxuspythonstack.sh ~/.shlib/shlibs/80-luxuspythonstack.sh

# Optional: I often open the entire .shlib folder in vsocde. For my convenience I created these links
ln -s ~/.zshrc ~/.shlib/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.p10k.zsh ~/.shlib/.p10k.zsh
# Your quickly editable favorites
```

* **Directory Structure**
```
~/.shlib/
├── exports/          # Secrets as env vars
│   ├── GITHUB_TOKEN
│   ├── PYPI_TOKEN
│   └── ...
├── shlibs/           # Sorted shell scripts
│   ├── 05-aliases.sh
│   ├── 10-zsh-config.sh
│   ├── ...
│   └── 80-luxuspythonstack.sh (link --> /path/to/deen-lupysta/luxuspythonstack.sh)
├── README.md
├── .zshrc (link --> ~/.zshrc)
└── .p10k.zsh (link --> ~/.p10k.zsh)
```

* **Lock Mechanism**

After cleaning `.zshrc` and moving configuration to shlib files, create a lock:

```shell
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.lock
```

On each shell start, the lock snippet compares `.zshrc` against `.zshrc.lock`. If different, a diff is shown — this catches installers modifying `.zshrc` without permission.

To update the lock after intentional changes: `cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.lock`.

Optional convenience alias — add to `~/.shlib/shlibs/05-aliases.sh`:

```shell
alias shliblock='cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.lock && echo "✔ shlib lock updated"'
```

* **Exports System**

Files in `~/.shlib/exports/` are exported as environment variables on shell start. The filename becomes the variable name, the file content (trimmed) becomes the value.

```shell
# echo "ghp_xxx" > ~/.shlib/exports/GITHUB_TOKEN
# Result: export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxx"
```

All export files should be `chmod 600` to prevent other users from reading secrets.


* **The exact content in .zshrc with the three snippets in the middle.**

```shell
# Enable Powerlevel10k instant prompt. Should stay close to the top of ~/.zshrc.
# Initialization code that may require console input (password prompts, [y/n]
# confirmations, etc.) must go above this block; everything else may go below.
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# >>>>>> SHLIB for zsh
# Shlib lock check (To avoid the power level warning, simply place this block before the power level code block)
SHLIB_RC_FILE="$HOME/.zshrc"; SHLIB_LOCK_FILE="$HOME/.zshrc.lock"
[ -f "$SHLIB_LOCK_FILE" ] && ! cmp -s "$SHLIB_RC_FILE" "$SHLIB_LOCK_FILE" && diff -u --color=always "$SHLIB_LOCK_FILE" "$SHLIB_RC_FILE"

# Exports all filenames in the folder as environment variables with the file content as the value.
export SHLIB_EXPORTS_DIR="$HOME/.shlib/exports"
[ -d "$SHLIB_EXPORTS_DIR" ] && for f in "$SHLIB_EXPORTS_DIR"/*(N); do [ -f "$f" ] && export "$(basename "$f")"="$(cat "$f")"; done

# Executes (sorted) all scripts in SHLIB_LIB_DIR that start with two digits.
export SHLIB_LIB_DIR="$HOME/.shlib/shlibs"
[ -d "$SHLIB_LIB_DIR" ] && for s in "$SHLIB_LIB_DIR"/[0-9][0-9]*(N); do [ -f "$s" ] && source "$s"; done
# <<<<<< SHLIB for zsh

# direnv hook (MUST BE AT THE ABSOLUTE END)
if command -v direnv > /dev/null; then
    eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
fi
```

#### Package Manager Policy

Simple guideline on how to install what.

| Layer | Tool | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| OS / System | `apt` / `nala` | Core packages, system daemons, C-libraries, compilers |
| GUI Apps | `flatpak` | Desktop applications (sandboxed) |
| Modern CLI | `brew` | CLI tools + TUIs not in apt |
| Python Global | `uv tool` | Python CLI utilities (ruff, basedpyright); `pipx` only as fallback if `uv` is unavailable |
| Python Project | `uv add` / `uv sync` | ALL project dependencies |
| Python Data Science | `mamba install` + `uv pip install` | Heavy C-extensions, CUDA, ML frameworks |
| Node | `pnpm` | All JS/TS dependencies |
| Rust | `cargo` | Rust binaries and project deps |
| Go | `go install` | Go-based CLI tools |
| Java | `sdk` (SDKMAN) | JDK versions + JVM tools |
| Ruby | `gem` / `bundle` | CLI tools + project deps |
